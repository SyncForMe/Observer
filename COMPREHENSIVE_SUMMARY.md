### **4. 📅 Comprehensive Day/Time Progression System**
- **✅ Time Structure**: Each day consists of Morning, Afternoon, and Evening
- **✅ Round Organization**: Each time period has 3 rounds
- **✅ Dynamic Display**: Header shows current day and time (e.g., "Day 1, Afternoon")
- **✅ Round Headers**: Each conversation shows "Day 1, Round 1, Morning"
- **✅ Backend Integration**: Automatic time calculation based on round progression
- **✅ User Isolation**: Each user has independent time progression

### **5. 🔄 3-Messages-Per-Agent System**
- **✅ Enhanced Conversations**: Each round now has 3 messages per agent (instead of 1)
- **✅ Turn-Based Structure**: Agents speak in turns (Turn 1: A,B,C → Turn 2: A,B,C → Turn 3: A,B,C)
- **✅ Richer Dialogue**: Much more substantial conversations with deeper analysis
- **✅ Context Building**: First turn includes full context, subsequent turns build on discussion
- **✅ Example**: 3 agents = 9 messages per round (3 × 3 messages per agent)

### **6. 🎯 UI/UX Improvements**
- **✅ Optimized Spacing**: Reduced spacing between control buttons and Live Conversations card by 62.5%
- **✅ Perfect Circular Avatars**: All agent avatars now display as perfect circles
- **✅ Professional Toggle**: Auto-report toggle properly contained within card boundaries
- **✅ Improved Layout**: Clean, organized interface with proper visual hierarchy
- **✅ Enhanced Navigation**: Streamlined design with better user flow

### **7. 🔧 Technical Enhancements**
- **✅ Dual LLM Architecture**: Supports both Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **✅ Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust error handling with meaningful fallbacks
- **✅ Database Integration**: Proper storage of time progression and conversation data
- **✅ Performance Optimization**: Efficient conversation generation and display
- **✅ Security**: Secure API key management and user data isolation
