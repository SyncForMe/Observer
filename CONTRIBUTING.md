  - üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  - üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
  - üö± `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
  - üìù `:memo:` when writing docs

  - üîí `:lock:` when dealing with security
  - ‚¨ÜÔ∏è `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
  - ‚¨áÔ∏è `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies

### Python Styleguide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting
- Use [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) for import sorting
- Add type hints to all function signatures
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Maximum line length is 88 characters (Black default)

#### Example:
```python
from typing import List, Optional

def create_agent(
    name: str,
    archetype: str,
    expertise: List[str],
    background: Optional[str] = None,
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Create a new AI agent with specified characteristics.
    
    Args:
        name: The agent's display name
        archetype: The personality archetype (e.g., 'scientist', 'leader')
        expertise: List of expertise areas
        background: Optional background story
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing the created agent's information
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If name or archetype is empty
    """
    if not name or not archetype:
        raise ValueError("Name and archetype are required")
        
    return {
        "name": name,
        "archetype": archetype,
        "expertise": expertise,
        "background": background or f"Expert in {', '.join(expertise)}",
    }
```

### JavaScript/React Styleguide

- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices for performance
- Use meaningful component and variable names

#### Example:
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

const AgentCard = ({ agent, onSelect, isSelected }) => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

  const handleSelect = useCallback(async () => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    try {
      await onSelect(agent.id);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to select agent:', error);
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  }, [agent.id, onSelect]);

  return (
    <div 
      className={`
        agent-card p-4 rounded-lg border transition-all duration-300
        ${isSelected ? 'border-purple-500 bg-purple-50' : 'border-gray-200 hover:border-gray-300'}
        ${isLoading ? 'opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed' : 'cursor-pointer'}
      `}
      onClick={handleSelect}
    >
      <h3 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">{agent.name}</h3>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{agent.archetype}</p>
      <p className="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-2">{agent.expertise.join(', ')}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

AgentCard.propTypes = {
  agent: PropTypes.shape({
    id: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    archetype: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    expertise: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.string).isRequired,
  }).isRequired,
  onSelect: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  isSelected: PropTypes.bool,
};

AgentCard.defaultProps = {
  isSelected: false,
};

export default AgentCard;
```

### CSS/Tailwind Styleguide

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Create custom components for repeated patterns
- Use semantic class names for custom CSS
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography scales

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Frontend Testing
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Write component tests for React components
- Write integration tests for complex user flows
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Aim for 80%+ test coverage

### Backend Testing
- Write unit tests for all functions
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Write end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Use pytest for Python testing
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for 90%+ test coverage

### Test Structure
```python
# backend/tests/test_agents.py
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from app.main import app

client = TestClient(app)

class TestAgentEndpoints:
    def test_create_agent_success(self):
        """Test successful agent creation."""
        agent_data = {
            "name": "Test Agent",
            "archetype": "scientist",
            "expertise": ["AI", "ML"],
        }
        response = client.post("/api/agents", json=agent_data)
        
        assert response.status_code == 201
        assert response.json()["name"] == "Test Agent"
        
    def test_create_agent_invalid_data(self):
        """Test agent creation with invalid data."""
        invalid_data = {"name": ""}  # Missing required fields
        response = client.post("/api/agents", json=invalid_data)
        
        assert response.status_code == 422
```
